# CAMO

A simple music program I wrote in Java during high school, that still mostly works! You can import your whole music library, most of it (probably just the mp3's) will play; you can make playlists and even change the UI colour!

To try it out:

1. Download the package
2. Open a terminal in the `dist` directory
3. Run `chmod +x ./CAMO.jar`
4. And the simply `./CAMO.jar` (assuming you have Java installed!)

Or just read it about on my blog at [A music app in Java](https://rdrn.me/music-app-for-me/) where I also posted a short video of the app in operation.
