1. Introduction
A simple music organiser, with playlist and smart playlists functions, a powerful search and basic playback functionality.

2. Getting started
Songs can be imported using the 'File' menu and then the 'Add File to Library...' or 'Add Folder to Library...' option. From there you can easily browse to the file or folder that you wish to import. Once the songs have been imported, you can perform other tasks such as searching, playback and creating playlists.

3. Playback
When you double click a song, or click the play toolbar while a song is selected, playback will begin immediately. The song information will then be displayed in the status bar and, optionally, in the title bar. You will be able to modify output volume with the volume slider and song progress will be displayed both graphically and numerically.

4. Playlists
4.1 Regular playlists
Playlists can be easily created by selecting the appropriate menu option or using the quick access button on the bottom left of the screen. Songs can then by added either via copying and pasting, or through the right-click menu option 'Add to Playlist'.

4.2 Smart playlists
Smart playlists work by taking a rule and calculating which songs in the library conform to that rule. To create one you can select the appropriate menu option or use the quick access button on the bottom left of the screen. You then need to specify a name and rule for the playlist. To do this, you select one of the rule categories from the drop down list and then type a word or words to act as the rule term. Any songs that conform to that rule will then be automatically displayed.

4.3 Playlist persistence
All playlists are automatically saved when the program exits.

5. Preferences
Through the preferences menu option, you can modify the following options:
a) whether to display now playing information in the title bar (next to 'CAMO').
b) the colour scheme for the program, which can be red, green or blue.

6. Minimal version
You can access the 'minimal' version of CAMO by pressing the 'Ctrl + M' key combination. This will take you to a simplified version of CAMO that only has the playback controls. You can return to the main window by exiting that minimal window.

7. Search
When you enter text in the search box, it automatically begins to search as you type. Any results corresponding to your search term will immediately be displayed.

9. Display sorting
By clicking on a heading for one of the columns, the output will be automatically sorted by that value.

10. Duplicate remover
By selecting the appropriate menu option, you can run a scan to automatically any duplicate music files in the library. This is based on the song's file path alone - if they have different names but the same file path, one will be deleted; if they have the same name but different file paths, nothing will be deleted.

11. Safety
CAMO does NOT modify any of your music files in any way or form, so you can safely test it out and do anything you want. Any name changes or song deletions occur ONLY in CAMO. You can safely return to another music player and find your music files EXACTLY as they were.

12. Music formats
At this stage, only MP3 music filse are supported.

13. Standard user interface
CAMO is designed to be very similar to most other music players, so it will be very easy to use immediately. Feel free to look around and see what you can do.
